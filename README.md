# PART 1 – BUILDING THE FOUNDATION

## 6. Part 1 – HTML Development

Part 1 focused on creating the basic structure and content of the Student Stay SA website.

The website was developed using HTML5 to create the structure of each page. The pages use headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, navigation, sections, articles, forms and footer content.

The five HTML pages were connected using navigation links so users can move between the different sections of the website.

Part 1 was initially developed strictly using HTML before CSS styling was introduced in Part 2.

### Part 1 Work Completed

- Planned the website and target audience.
- Created the Student Stay SA project concept.
- Researched website content and images.
- Created five HTML pages.
- Added headings, paragraphs, lists and accommodation information.
- Added accommodation photographs.
- Created enquiry and contact forms using HTML.
- Added navigation links between all pages.
- Organised the project into a clear file and folder structure.
- Tested the website pages and navigation.

## 7. Part 1 File and Folder Structure

```text
Student Stay SA
├── index.html
├── listings.html
├── about.html
├── enquiry.html
├── contact.html
├── README.md
└── assets
    └── css
        └── style.css
```

The `style.css` file was introduced and used as part of Part 2.

# PART 2 – CSS STYLING AND RESPONSIVE DESIGN

## 8. Part 2 – CSS Development

Part 2 focused on improving the visual appearance of the website and making the website responsive.

An external CSS stylesheet was created at:

```text
assets/css/style.css
```

The stylesheet is linked to all five HTML pages using:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">
```

## 9. CSS Styling Completed

### Base Styling

- CSS reset.
- Box sizing.
- Default font styling.
- Consistent colours.
- Margins and padding.
- General page styling.

### Typography

CSS was used to control:

- Font family.
- Font size.
- Font weight.
- Line height.
- Heading hierarchy.
- Text spacing.

### Layout

The website uses:

- Flexbox.
- CSS Grid.
- Flexible containers.
- Multi-column accommodation cards.
- Responsive sections.
- Structured header and footer layouts.

### Visual Styling

The website includes:

- Background colours.
- Text colours.
- Borders.
- Rounded corners.
- Box shadows.
- Styled buttons.
- Navigation effects.
- Hover states.
- Focus states.

## 10. Responsive Design

The website was designed to adjust to different screen sizes.

### Desktop

On larger screens:

- Navigation is displayed horizontally.
- Accommodation cards are displayed in multiple columns.
- Sections have more available space.
- Images scale to fit their containers.

### Tablet

At medium screen sizes:

- The layout changes to fewer columns.
- Content remains readable.
- Images resize to fit the available space.
- Navigation and sections adjust to the smaller screen.

### Mobile

At smaller screen sizes:

- Navigation items are stacked.
- Accommodation cards use a single-column layout.
- Content uses the available screen width.
- Images scale down correctly.
- Forms become easier to use on smaller screens.

Media queries are used in the stylesheet to make these adjustments.

## 11. Responsive Images

The website uses responsive image techniques such as `srcset` and `sizes`. Images are also styled so that they fit within their containers without overflowing the page.

## 12. Browser Testing and Screenshot Evidence

The website should be tested using browser developer tools at different screen sizes. The required evidence includes:

- Desktop view.
- Tablet view.
- Mobile view.

The screenshots should be placed in the `screenshots` folder.

Recommended structure:

```text
Student Stay SA
├── screenshots
│   ├── desktop.png
│   ├── tablet.png
│   └── mobile.png
├── assets
│   └── css
│       └── style.css
├── index.html
├── listings.html
├── about.html
├── enquiry.html
├── contact.html
└── README.md
```

### Desktop View

**Insert the actual desktop screenshot here:**

`![Desktop View](screenshots/desktop.png)`

### Tablet View

**Insert the actual tablet screenshot here:**

`![Tablet View](screenshots/tablet.png)`

### Mobile View

**Insert the actual mobile screenshot here:**

`![Mobile View](screenshots/mobile.png)`

The screenshots must be taken from the actual Student Stay SA website. They should not be replaced with made-up images.

## 13. Testing and Debugging

The website was checked for:

- Working navigation links.
- Correct page names.
- Correct CSS file path.
- Images displaying correctly.
- Readable text.
- Responsive layout.
- Form fields displaying correctly.
- Desktop, tablet and mobile layouts.

Any corrections made after testing should be recorded in the changelog.

## 16. Part 2 Limitations

The current version is a front-end student project.

The enquiry and contact forms do not have a server-side system connected to them yet. The accommodation listings and prices are illustrative rather than verified live rental listings.

More advanced functionality such as JavaScript interactivity, JavaScript form validation, SEO work and deployment will be addressed in later stages of the project where required by the PoE.

## 17. Future Development

Possible future improvements include:

- JavaScript functionality.
- Form validation.
- Interactive maps.
- Search and filtering.
- Dynamic accommodation listings.
- Improved enquiry processing.
- Website deployment.
- SEO improvements.

These features are outside the main CSS and responsive-design focus of Part 2.
